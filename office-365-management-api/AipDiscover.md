# AipDiscover

Azure Information Protection is a service that allows organizations to classify and label sensitive data, and apply policies to control how that data is accessed and shared.

AipDiscover is a type of event that is recorded in the Office 365 Unified Audit Log. It represents an attempt to discover or access an Azure Information Protection (AIP) protected file. In the scenario in which an AIPDiscover event shows the operation as discover that means the file has been listed within an on-premise file share, SharePoint server, etc. that is being viewed by a user or information protection scanner and the state of the file is at rest. In the scenario that an AIPDiscover event shows the operations as access that means the file has been opened and is in use by the user when the event was recorded.

The AIPDiscover event is useful because it shows the users, devices, and locations that are accessing Azure Information Protection labeled information within an organization.

## Access the Office 365 Unified Audit Log

The audit logs can be accessed using the following methods:

- The [Audit Log search tool](#audit-log-search-tool) in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.
- The [Search-UnifiedAuditLog](#search-unified-audit-log-in-powershell) cmdlet in Exchange Online PowerShell.
- The [Office 365 Management Activity API](#office-365-management-activity-api).

To view descriptions of the data fields within an audit event, see [Attributes of an AipDiscover event](#attributes-of-the-aipdiscover-event)

### Audit log search tool

1. Go to the [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://sip.compliance.microsoft.com/homepage) and sign in.
2. In the left pane of the compliance portal, select **Audit**.
   > [!Note]
   > If you don't see **Audit** in the left pane, see [Roles and role groups in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Microsoft Purview compliance](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/scc-permissions?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true) for information about permissions.
3. On the **New Search** tab, set Record type to **AipDiscover** and configure the other parameters.

4. Click **Search** to run the search using the criteria. In the results pane, select an event to view the results. Both discover and access operations can be viewed.

For more information on viewing the audit logs in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, see [Audit log activities](/microsoft-365/compliance/audit-log-activities).

## Search Unified Audit Log in PowerShell

To access the Unified Audit Log using PowerShell, first connect to an Exchange Online PowerShell session by completing the following steps.

### Establish a remote PowerShell session

This will establish a remote PowerShell session with Exchange Online. Once the connection is established, you can run Exchange Online cmdlets to manage your Exchange Online environment.

Open a PowerShell window and run the Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement command to install the Exchange Online Management module. This module provides cmdlets that can be used to manage Exchange Online.

1. Connect-IPPSSession is a PowerShell cmdlet used to create a remote connection to an Exchange Online PowerShell session.
2. Import-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement is a PowerShell cmdlet used to import the Exchange Online Management module into the current PowerShell session.

```powershell
# Import the PSSSession and Exchange Online cmdlets
Connect-IPPSSession
Import-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement
```

#### Connect with a specific user

Command to prompt for a specific user for your Exchange Online credentials.

```powershell
$UserCredential = Get-Credential 
```

Command to connect to Exchange Online using the provided credentials.

```powershell
Connect-ExchangeOnline -Credential $UserCredential -ShowProgress $true 
```

#### Connect with credentials in the current session

Connect to Exchange Online using the credentials in the current session.

```powershell
Connect-ExchangeOnline
```

## Search-UnifiedAuditLog cmdlet

The Search-UnifiedAuditLog cmdlet is a PowerShell command that can be used to search the Office 365 Unified Audit Log. The Unified Audit Log is a record of user and administrator activity in Office 365 that can be used to track events. For best practices on using this cmdlet, see [Best Practices for using Search-UnifiedAuditLog](aip-unified-audit-logs-best-practices.md).

To extract the AipDiscover events from the Unified Audit Log using PowerShell, you can use the following command. This will search the Unified Audit Log for the specified date range and return any events with the record type "AipDiscover". The results will be exported to a CSV file at the specified path.

```powershell
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -RecordType AipDiscover -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-100) -EndDate (Get-Date) | Export-Csv -Path <output file>
```

Use the following command to specifically search for discover events - the scenario in which the files are discovered by the user or information protection scanner through viewing on-premise files shares, SharePoint servers, etc. An example of the result of the PowerShell cmdlet is also shown below.

```powershell
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -Operations Discover -RecordType AipDiscover -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-100) -EndDate (Get-Date)
```

The following is an example of AipDiscover event from PowerShell, operation Discover.
