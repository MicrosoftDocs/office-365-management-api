# Office 365 Management Activity API schema

The Office 365 Management Activity API schema is provided as a data service in  two layers:

- **Common schema**. The interface to access core Office 365 auditing concepts such as Record Type, Creation Time, User Type, and Action as well as to provide core dimensions (such as User ID), location specifics (such as Client IP address), and service-specific properties (such as Object ID). It establishes consistent and uniform views for users to extract all Office 365 audit data in a few top level views with the appropriate parameters, and provides a fixed schema for all the data sources, which significantly reduces the cost of learning. Common schema is sourced from product data that is owned by each product team, such as Exchange, SharePoint, Azure Active Directory, Yammer, and OneDrive for Business. The Object ID field can be extended by Microsoft 365 product teams to add service-specific properties.

- **Service-specific schema**. Built on top of the Common schema to provide a set of Microsoft 365 service-specific attributes; for example, SharePoint schema, OneDrive for Business schema, and Exchange admin schema.

## Common schema

**EntityType Name**: AuditRecord

|Parameter|Type|Mandatory?|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Id|Combination GUIDEdm.Guid|Yes|Unique identifier of an audit record.|
|RecordType|Self.[AuditLogRecordType](#auditlogrecordtype)|Yes|The type of operation indicated by the record. See the [AuditLogRecordType](#auditlogrecordtype) table for details on the types of audit log records.|
|CreationTime|Edm.Date|Yes|The date and time in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) when the audit log record was generated.|
|Operation|Edm.String|Yes|The name of the user or admin activity. For a description of the most common operations/activities, see [Search the audit log in the Office 365 Protection Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=708432). For Exchange admin activity, this property identifies the name of the cmdlet that was run. For Dlp events, this can be "DlpRuleMatch", "DlpRuleUndo" or "DlpInfo", which are described under "DLP schema" below.|
|OrganizationId|Edm.Guid|Yes|The GUID for your organization's Office 365 tenant. This value will always be the same for your organization, regardless of the Office 365 service in which it occurs.|
|UserType|Self.[UserType](#user-type)|Yes|The type of user that performed the operation. See the [UserType](#user-type) table for details on the types of users.|
|UserKey|Edm.String|Yes|An alternative ID for the user identified in the UserId property. This property is populated with the passport unique ID (PUID) for events performed by users in SharePoint, OneDrive for Business, and Exchange. |
|Workload|Edm.String|Yes|The Office 365 service where the activity occurred.|
|ResultStatus|Edm.String|No|Indicates whether the action (specified in the Operation property) was successful or not. Possible values are **Succeeded**, **PartiallySucceeded**, or **Failed**. For Exchange admin activity, the value is either **True** or **False**.<br/><br/>**Important**: Different workloads may overwrite the value of the ResultStatus property. For example, for Microsoft Entra ID STS logon events, a value of **Succeeded** for ResultStatus indicates only that the HTTP operation was successful; it doesn't mean the logon was successful. To determine if the actual logon was successful or not, see the LogonError property in the [Microsoft Entra ID STS Logon schema](#azure-active-directory-secure-token-service-sts-logon-schema). If the logon failed, the value of this property will contain the reason for the failed logon attempt. |
|ObjectId|Edm.string|No|For SharePoint and OneDrive for Business activity, the full path name of the file or folder accessed by the user. For Exchange admin audit logging, the name of the object that was modified by the cmdlet. For Cloud Policy service, the object ID of the policy configuration.|
|UserId|Edm.string|Yes|The UPN (User Principal Name) of the user who performed the action (specified in the Operation property) that resulted in the record being logged; for example, `my_name@my_domain_name`. Note that records for activity performed by system accounts (such as SHAREPOINT\system or NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) are also included. In SharePoint, another value display in the UserId property is app@sharepoint. This indicates that the "user" who performed the activity was an application that has the necessary permissions in SharePoint to perform organization-wide actions (such as search a SharePoint site or OneDrive account) on behalf of a user, admin, or service. For more information, see [The app@sharepoint user in audit records](/microsoft-365/compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance#the-appsharepoint-user-in-audit-records). |
|ClientIP|Edm.String|Yes|The IP address of the device that was used when the activity was logged. The IP address is displayed in either an IPv4 or IPv6 address format.<br/><br/>For some services, the value displayed in this property might be the IP address for a trusted application (for example, Office on the web apps) calling into the service on behalf of a user and not the IP address of the device used by person who performed the activity. <br/><br/>Also, for Microsoft Entra ID-related events, the IP address isn't logged and the value for the ClientIP property is `null`.|
|Scope|Self.[AuditLogScope](#auditlogscope)|No|Was this event created by a hosted O365 service or an on-premises server? Possible values are **online** and **onprem**. Note that SharePoint is the only workload currently sending events from on-premises to O365.|
|AppAccessContext|CollectionSelf.[AppAccessContext](#complex-type-appaccesscontext)|No|The application context for the user or service principal that performed the action.|

## DLP schema

DLP events are available for Exchange Online, Endpoint(devices) and SharePoint Online, and OneDrive For Business. Note that DLP events in Exchange are only available for events based on unified DLP policy (e.g. configured via Security & Compliance Center). DLP events based on Exchange Transport Rules are not supported.

DLP (Data Loss Prevention) events will always have UserKey="DlpAgent" in the common schema. There are three types of DlpEvents that are stored as the value of the Operation property of the common schema:

- DlpRuleMatch - This indicates a rule was matched. These events exist in all Exchange, Endpoint(devices) and SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business. For Exchange it includes false positive and override information. For SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business, false positive and overrides generate separate events.

- DlpRuleUndo - These only exist in SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business, and indicate a previously applied policy action has been "undone" – either because of false positive/override designation by user, or because the document is no longer subject to policy (either due to policy change or change to content in doc).

- DlpInfo - These only exist in SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business and indicate a false positive designation but no action was "undone."

## MIP label schema

Events in the Microsoft Purview Information Protection label schema are triggered when Microsoft 365 detects an email message processed by agents in the Transport pipeline that has a sensitivity label applied to it. The sensitivity label may have been applied manually or automatically, and it may have been applied within or outside of the Transport pipeline. Sensitivity labels can be automatically applied to email messages by auto-apply label policies.

The intent of this audit schema is to represent the sum of all email activity that involves sensitivity labels. In other words, there should be an recorded audit activity for each email message that is sent to or from users in the organization that has a sensitivity label applied to it, regardless of when or how the sensitivity label was applied. For more information about sensitivity labels, see:

- [Learn about sensitivity labels](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels)

- [Apply a sensitivity label to content automatically](/microsoft-365/compliance/apply-sensitivity-label-automatically)

## Encrypted message portal events schema

Events for enrypted message portal schema are triggered when when Purview Message Encryption detects an encrypted email message is accessed through the portal by an external recipient. The mail may have been encrypted manually with a sensitivity label or an RMS template, or automatically by a transport rule, a Data Loss Prevention policy, or an auto-labeling policy.

The intent of this audit schema is to represent the sum of all portal activity that involves accessing the encrypted mail by external recipients. In other words, there should be a recorded audit activity for a recipient that attempts to sign in to the portal and any activities related to accessing the encrypted mail. This includes mail sent to or from users in the organization when the mail has encryption applied to it, regardless of when or how the encryption was applied. For more information, see, [Learn about encrypted message portal logs](/microsoft-365/compliance/ome-message-access-logs).
