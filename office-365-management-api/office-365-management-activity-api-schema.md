# Office 365 Management Activity API schema
 
The Office 365 Management Activity API schema is provided as a data service in  two layers:

- **Common schema**. The interface to access core Office 365 auditing concepts such as Record Type, Creation Time, User Type, and Action as well as to provide core dimensions (such as User ID), location specifics (such as Client IP address), and product-specific properties (such as Object ID). It establishes consistent and uniform views for users to extract all Office 365 audit data in a few top level views with the appropriate parameters, and provides a fixed schema for all the data sources, which significantly reduces the cost of learning. Common schema is sourced from product data that is owned by each product team, such as Exchange, SharePoint, Azure Active Directory, Yammer, and OneDrive for Business. The Object ID field can be extended by product teams to add product specific properties.
    
- **Product-specific schema**. Built on top of the Common schema to provide a set of product-specific attributes; for example, Sway schema, SharePoint schema, OneDrive for Business schema, and Exchange admin schema.
    
**Which layer should you use for your scenario?**
In general, if the data is available in a higher layer, don't go back to a lower layer. In other words, if the data requirement can be fit in a product-specific schema, you don't need to go back to the Common schema.

- "DlpRuleMatch":  This indicates a rule was matched. These events exist in both Exchange and SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business. For Exchange it includes false positive and override information. For SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business, false positive and overrides generate separate events.
- "DlpRuleUndo": These only exist in SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business, and indicate a previously applied policy action has been “undone” – either because of false positive/override designation by user, or because the document is no longer subject to policy (either due to policy change or change to content in doc).
